Nowadays there are many options. If we know coding a little bit we can even ask AI Chats, like Chat GPT, Bing Chat etc. AI is completely different topic big enough for another series of articles. That's why below I describe the more traditional ways.

### Site Generators ###
We can use site generators on hosting providers like:
- Wix
- Squarespace
- Shopify
- Wordpress.com
- etc.

### CMS ###
Another option is CMS.  
**CMS** - content management system. This type of software helps to build pages. Normally, web pages are written in HTML, JavaScript, and CSS programming languages. To build pages you should learn them or use any CMS. Some hosting providers use their own site builders like shown above. However, there are many which are not hosting dependent. The most popular ones are:
- WordPress
- Drupal
- Joomla

### Static Page ###
A static website has fixed content.
It is the easiest form of website to create.
This involves coding the page using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There are plenty of courses about that. One of the most popular is [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/).  
This type of page is sufficient for sample pages. More sophisticated solutions use dynamic loading of content.

### Dynamic Pages ###
They are usually built in the way that the skeleton is made as usual in HTML and CSS. The content is being loaded by JavaScript. Usually, it is not pure "vanilla JS", but a JS script built using a framework.  
A **framework**, or development platform, is a type of support software used by developers to structure applications. To define frameworks, they can be defined as sets of ready-made solutions and tools that help IT professionals build applications.  
The most popular JS Frameworks are:
- React
- Angular
- Vue
- Svelte

There is also **Node.js**.  
Node.js is not just a framework but a platform that allows running JavaScript scripts outside the browser and executing it on the server side. Thatâ€™s what Node.js is used for by JavaScript developers. It is well-scalable and high-performant as it relies on the event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. This makes Node.js an excellent choice for building real-time web applications, APIs, microservices, and server-side applications.  

### Web App ###
A web application is a dynamic page which uses JS not only to load content but also to manage the flow of data through the HTML protocol from the backend.  
What is the **backend**? It can be written that the backend is everything that users do not see, which is needed for the operation of a website or application. The backend is what is on the server that the user does not have direct access to. Backend is responsible for all the data management which frontend cannot do. As **frontend** we mean everything that the user can see. So the end product is a skeleton in HTML and CSS with data loaded by a JS framework.

Backend can be done in almost any programming language, but the most popular ones are:
- PHP
- Node.js - JS framework which can perform also server-side tasks
- Java
- C#
- Python
- Ruby
- Golang
- TypeScript 
- Rust
- Kotlin

### My choice ###
I selected to build the blog using solutions available for GitHub pages. That's why I describe this solution in the next articles.
