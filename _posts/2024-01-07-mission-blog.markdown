I'm starting a series of articles about writing a blog. They will focus on the things you should know to start, from the setup to looking for inspiration. The initial list of topics would look like this:
  -  Selecting hosting
  -  Creating a domain
  -  Comparing various frameworks
  -  GitHub and GitHub Pages
      -  First page
      - Selecting a template
      - Writing the first posts

Stay tuned for more.
