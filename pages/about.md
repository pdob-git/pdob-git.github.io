# About Perfeton Blog

Hi, here is Pablo.

I decided to create a blog to store and share knowledge that I gathered during my journey of exploring areas of expertise, such as programming and investing. During the COVID-19 pandemic, I started learning programming in Java. Now, my area of interest is evolving to consolidate my Java knowledge, learn Python, and start investing in general, with some focus on cryptocurrencies.

As I'm building the blog, I also have to face some obstacles that need to be resolved. So, you will also find some information on frontend and DevOps as I will be solving and documenting issues in my blog journey.

Sounds interesting? You are more than welcome to read my posts and find something interesting for you.

I also plan to share instructions on how you can collaborate and get involved in writing posts, for example.

Regards,\
Pablo from Perfeton.
