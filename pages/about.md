# About Perfeton Blog

Hi Here is Pablo,

I decided to create blog to store and share knowledge I gather during my journey
of exploring areas of expertise like programming and investing.
During COVID-19 pandemia time I started learning programming in Java.
Now my area of interest is evolving to consolide my Java knowledge,
learn Python and start investing in general with some focus on Cruptocurrencies.

As I'm building blog I also have to face some obstacles which have to be resolved.
So You will find also some info on Fronend and Devops as I will be solving and documenting
issues in my blog yourney.

Sounds intresting? You are more than welcome read my posts and find something intersting for you.

I also plan to share instruction how you can collaborate and get involved in writing the post for example.

Regards,\
Pablo form Perfeton.
